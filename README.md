# Purple Dino Books

Besides being an indie-coder, I am also an indie-author! Over the coming years, I plan to launch a variety of books that showcase my storytelling skills, illustrations, and photography. This website serves as a hub for my creative work, where visitors can explore the books I’ve launched so far. Each book has its own dedicated section with a description, cover image, and a link to purchase, making it easy for readers to dive into these imaginative worlds.

## About the Build
The Purple Dino Books website is a single-page application built with the React library for a responsive and seamless user experience. Styled with custom CSS, the site is designed to be both visually appealing and easy to navigate. The website is deployed on Netlify, enabling fast, reliable access and simplifying future updates with continuous deployment directly from GitHub.

This project is an evolving showcase of my journey as an indie-author, where I can easily add new books as they’re launched. As I continue expanding my creative portfolio, Purple Dino Books will serve as a growing collection of stories, illustrations, and photographs to share with my readers.
